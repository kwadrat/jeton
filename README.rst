It allows for transferring data by:

* TCP streams

* from/to file

* from/to stdio


It allows for operations:

* duplicating data stream - for example writing simultaneously to file and to TCP connection

* calculating MD5 sum (TODO)

* generate certain amount of data

* measuring the speed of data processing/moving

* changing the size of memory buffer

* using single buffer

* using multiple buffers and two threads (reader, writer) for smoother transfers
